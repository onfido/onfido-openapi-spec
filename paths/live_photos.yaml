        You can upload live photos to this endpoint. Like document upload, files must be uploaded as a multipart form.
        Valid file types are jpg, png and pdf. The file size must be between 32KB and 10MB.
        Live photos are validated at the point of upload to check that they contain exactly one face.
        This validation can be disabled by setting the advanced_validation argument to false.
